<h2>The Theory</h2>
<p>
In chemistry, organic compounds are generally any chemical compounds that contain carbon-hydrogen bonds. 
Due to carbon's ability to catenate (form chains with other carbon atoms), millions of organic compounds are known. 
The study of the properties, reactions, and syntheses of organic compounds comprises the discipline known as organic chemistry.

<p>
In organic chemistry, an alkane, or paraffin (a historical name that also has other meanings), 
is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon.
In other words, an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure 
in which all the carbonâ€“carbon bonds are single.

Alkanes have the general chemical formula CnH2n+2.
